# Python-Hangman-Game
A simple game of hangman created using python programming language. The program display a 'fill in the blank' game that asks the user to guess the letters to name the states of India. If the user guesses the state correctly within the specified number of chances then he or she is declared a winner and a rudimentary stick-figure drawing of a 'hanged man' is displayed.
The program incorporates three modules: random, Counter from collections and turtle. It uses both for and while loop, if, elif and else conditional statements along with try and except blocks for exception handling.
The main data structure used is string with built-in functions like split(), len(), input(), and print(). Random uses choice(), Counter uses count() and turtle uses Screen(), bgcolor(), color(),
pensize(), left(), right(), forward(), circle() and done().
